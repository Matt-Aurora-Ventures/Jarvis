# Copy to `tokens.env` (gitignored) and fill with real BotFather tokens.
# These are used by the "Clawd*" Telegram bots when running locally or on VPS.
#
# NOTE:
# - Keep tokens private. Treat this file like a password vault.
# - Each bot must have its own token to avoid Telegram polling conflicts (409).
