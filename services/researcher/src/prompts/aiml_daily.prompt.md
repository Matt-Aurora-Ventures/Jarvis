  workflow engines, safety, long-context, compression, and cost reduction.
- Rank items by likely impact to Jarvis in the next 90 days.

Output:
- daily_digest
- ranked_candidates[]
- recommended_experiments[]

Constraints:
- No claims without citations.
- Prefer primary sources (papers, official docs, official repos).
