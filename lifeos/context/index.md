# LifeOS Context Index

## Load Order (highest priority first)
1. goals.md
2. principles.md
3. context/projects/inbox.md
4. context/finance/inbox.md
5. context/habits/inbox.md

## Routing Rules (initial)
- Goals, priorities, and outcomes go to `goals.md`.
- Safety rules, constraints, and critique standards go to `principles.md`.
- Project updates go into `context/projects/inbox.md`.
- Finance notes go into `context/finance/inbox.md`.
- Habit routines and tracking notes go into `context/habits/inbox.md`.

## Notes
- This index is read every run to decide what context to load.
- When routing is unclear, LifeOS will ask for confirmation and then add a rule here.
- Entries tagged with `[Needs routing]` require manual categorization.
