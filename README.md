## 🌐 What Jarvis Is

Jarvis is not a product in the traditional sense.
It is not just an app, a bot, a trading system, or an AI assistant.

**Jarvis is a persistent, personal context engine**—a mesh of intelligent layers and smart agents that work together to quietly run, optimize, and upgrade your life in the background.

### The Vision

The inspiration is simple and familiar: **the Iron Man version of Jarvis**—the system that quietly upgrades your life without demanding your attention. Something that knows you across all of your devices. Something that understands your preferences, habits, goals, frustrations, and patterns—without you needing to constantly configure it, prompt it, or manage it.

Today's AI tools exist in isolation.
- Each one has its own interface
- Its own workflows
- Its own learning curve

**You are expected to orchestrate them.**

Jarvis flips that model entirely.

**Instead of you adapting to software, the software adapts to you.**

### Context Is the Product

Jarvis tracks context across your life.

Not just commands.
Not just prompts.
Not just conversations.

Context includes:
- Your preferences
- Your routines
- Your constraints
- Your financial posture
- Your goals
- Your risk tolerance
- Your attention patterns
- Your digital footprint
- Your environment over time

By unifying this context, Jarvis becomes **a single operational layer that sits quietly beneath everything else**.

You don't need to be a power user.
You don't need to understand AI workflows.
You don't need to be technical.
**You don't need to understand crypto.**

Jarvis exists so you don't have to manage complexity at all.

### From Assistance to Autonomy

In the beginning, Jarvis assists.

- It observes
- It suggests
- It explains
- It optimizes

**Over time, Jarvis earns autonomy.**

Nowhere is this clearer than in trading.

Jarvis is designed to evolve into **a fully autonomous trading engine**—one that:
- Operates on-chain
- Executes transparently
- Learns from outcomes
- Compounds both capital and intelligence
- Improves itself continuously
- **Works while you sleep**

Trading is the first domain where Jarvis becomes truly autonomous because it is **measurable, auditable, and objective**.

From there, autonomy expands outward—into scheduling, optimization, installations, coordination, and eventually the broader mechanics of daily life.

### The End Goal

Jarvis is not trying to replace humans.

**It is trying to remove friction.**

It is a persistent, personal context engine that quietly unifies intelligence, automation, finance, and daily life into a single system—one that works in the background, upgrades itself, and upgrades you along the way.

## 🚀 Why Crypto First (But Not Crypto Only)

Jarvis started in crypto **intentionally**.

Not because it was meant to be only a crypto product—but because **crypto is the one environment where the future already exists**.

### The Proving Ground

In its first phase, Jarvis lives natively on **Solana**. This is not an accident or a branding choice. Solana provides something no other ecosystem currently can: **a fully on-chain, real-time, high-frequency environment** where data, assets, execution, analytics, and automation are all transparent, composable, and verifiable by design.

Crypto offers:
- Real-time markets
- On-chain execution
- Transparent outcomes
- Autonomous capital movement
- Programmable incentives
- Global, permissionless access

These properties make crypto **the ideal proving ground for autonomy**.

Jarvis launches with a strong trading and analytics context not because trading is the end goal—but because **it is the hardest place to build something real**. Markets are unforgiving. They provide immediate feedback. They expose bad logic quickly. And they reward systems that can learn, adapt, and execute correctly under pressure.

### Crypto Is the Training Ground, Not the Identity

In this sense, **crypto is not Jarvis's identity**.
It is **Jarvis's training ground**.

If a system can survive markets, it can survive anything.

Once Jarvis proves itself in trading—operating autonomously, generating value, and continuously improving—it expands outward into:
- Productivity
- Communication
- Devices
- Health
- Smart homes
- Vehicles
- Robots

The architecture is designed for this from day one.

---

## 🧩 The Architecture: A Mesh of Smart Agents

Jarvis is not one monolithic intelligence.

It is **a mesh of smart agents and intelligent layers**, each responsible for observing, understanding, and improving different parts of your digital and real-world environment.

### The Core Layers

```
Context → Intelligence → Action → Feedback → Memory
```

Everything in Jarvis fits into one of these layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Context** | Signals from devices, apps, chains, and your environment |
| **Intelligence** | Reasoning, planning, and evaluation (model-agnostic) |
| **Action** | Execution across domains (finance, productivity, communication, devices) |
| **Feedback** | Learning from outcomes |
| **Memory** | Short-term, long-term, and reflective storage |

### The Agents

These agents:
- Share context
- Coordinate through a unified memory
- Learn from outcomes
- Compress and refine knowledge over time
- Operate locally and securely
- **Remain optional and non-blocking**

**If an AI agent goes offline, Jarvis continues to function normally.** Intelligence is additive, not required. Trust is earned, not assumed.

This mesh architecture allows Jarvis to scale horizontally across:
- Devices
- Applications
- Environments
- Domains
- Physical systems (future)

### Autonomy Is Gated

Jarvis doesn't start with full autonomy. **It earns trust through success**:
- Successful actions without errors
- Accurate predictions
- User satisfaction feedback
- Time-weighted reputation building

Every autonomous action is:
- Auditable
- Reversible
- Transparent
- Gated by permission levels

You remain in control. Always.

## 💎 Economic Model: Open Source First

Jarvis is built on first principles.

It is:
- **Free**
- **Open-source**
- **Self-upgrading**
- **Always migrating toward smaller, faster, more powerful models**

It runs on a new local node architecture powered by **LLaMA-based models** and free access to advanced intelligence through Claude-compatible runtimes. This makes Jarvis viable at **ultra-low cost**, without subscriptions, without data extraction, and without centralized control.

**Your data stays local.**
**Your context stays yours.**
**Your intelligence compounds over time.**

### Revenue Distribution

The economic model is intentionally simple and aligned:

| Allocation | Percentage | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Holders** | 75% | Value flows directly to $KR8TIV token holders |
| **Charity** | 5% | Supports open-source projects and community causes |
| **Founder** | 20% | Sustains ongoing development |

This structure ensures that:
- Users benefit directly from adoption
- Incentives remain aligned long-term
- Value creation is shared, not hoarded
- The system can sustain itself without rent-seeking

### The Linux of AI Context

Jarvis is built with the same ethos as Linux:
- Open
- Composable
- Community-owned
- Endlessly adaptable

We are building the **Linux of AI context models**—something that levels the playing field, making advanced AI accessible to the "little guy," not just engineers or specialists.

## 🧠 Consensus + Context + Mesh (Feb 2026)

Jarvis now includes a production-grade consensus and context stack with explicit degraded-mode behavior.

### Consensus Arena
- `core/consensus/scoring.py`: hybrid scoring (semantic agreement + reasoning heuristics + confidence extraction + model priors).
- `core/consensus/arena.py`: async fan-out to model panel via LiteLLM/OpenRouter with consensus synthesis.
- `core/resilient_provider.py`: consensus route integrated with graceful fallback to local Ollama.
- `bots/supervisor.py`: startup capability warnings for missing dependencies/flags.

### Supermemory Lifecycle Hooks
- `bots/shared/supermemory_client.py` now supports pre-recall and post-response hooks.
- Dual-profile prompt injection is wired into `lifeos/jarvis.py`:
  - Static profile (long-term preferences).
  - Dynamic profile (recent focus/context).
- Research notebook writes are tagged (`container_tag=\"research_notebooks\"`).

### Mesh Sync + Attestation
- `services/compute/mesh_sync_service.py`: post-write state delta emission, envelope validation, and retryable outbox.
- `services/compute/mesh_attestation_service.py`: Solana state-hash attestation interface.
- Supermemory write success now triggers: `publish -> validate -> attest` (non-blocking to user writes).
- Integration test coverage includes mocked NATS + mocked Solana RPC for end-to-end mesh flow.

### Control Plane + Capability Truth
- `core/ai_control_plane.py` and `/api/ai/control-plane` provide operator snapshot for consensus, context, upgrader, and compute.
- `core/roadmap_capabilities.py` + `/api/roadmap/capabilities` drive roadmap status from implementation evidence.
- `frontend/src/pages/AIControlPlane.jsx` and `frontend/src/pages/Roadmap.jsx` render status-first operational views.

### Phase 5/6 Operational Feeds
- New backend feeds and routes for Advanced Tools and Polish & Scale:
  - `/api/advanced/mev`
  - `/api/advanced/multi-dex`
  - `/api/advanced/perps/status`
  - `/api/analytics/portfolio`
  - `/api/runtime/capabilities`
  - `/api/polish/themes/status`
  - `/api/polish/onboarding/status`

## 🧠 The Portable Brain

One of Jarvis's unique features is **the Portable Brain**—a system that makes your AI context **truly portable** across devices, platforms, and even other AI systems.

### What Is It?

The Portable Brain is:
- A unified memory format
- Cross-session context preservation
- Device-agnostic intelligence
- Exportable/importable knowledge base

### How It Works

```python
# Export your Jarvis brain
from core.memory.portable_brain import BrainExporter

exporter = BrainExporter()
brain_file = exporter.export_brain(user_id="you", output_path="my_jarvis_brain.json")

# Import to another device or system
from core.memory.portable_brain import BrainImporter

importer = BrainImporter()
importer.import_brain(brain_file="my_jarvis_brain.json", target_user="you")
```

### What Gets Preserved

- Trading preferences and risk tolerance
- Learned patterns and habits
- Conversation history and context
- Model preferences and tuning
- Trust ladder progress
- Custom automations

This means:
- Switch devices seamlessly
- Backup your AI's knowledge of you
- Share context with other AI systems (future)
- Never lose your personalization

## 🧬 Self-Evolution System

Jarvis learns and improves itself through a structured self-evolution system.

### The Trust Ladder

Jarvis earns autonomy through successful actions:

| Level | Autonomy | Requirements |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **0: Supervised** | None | Starting point |
| **1: Assisted** | Suggest actions | 10 successful assists |
| **2: Monitored** | Execute with confirmation | 50 successful executions |
| **3: Autonomous** | Execute without asking | 200 successful actions, 0 major errors |
| **4: Trusted** | Proactive suggestions | 1000 successful actions, high user satisfaction |

### Learning Loop

```
Observe → Predict → Act → Measure → Reflect → Improve
```

1. **Observe**: Collect data from actions and outcomes
2. **Predict**: Generate hypotheses about what will work
3. **Act**: Execute (within permission level)
4. **Measure**: Track success metrics (P&L, engagement, accuracy)
5. **Reflect**: Nightly analysis of what worked/failed
6. **Improve**: Update models, strategies, and behaviors

### Memory System

| Memory Type | Retention | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Short-term** | 1 day | Active context, current tasks |
| **Working** | 7 days | Recent patterns, temp learnings |
| **Long-term** | Permanent | Proven strategies, user preferences |
| **Episodic** | Permanent | Significant events, major decisions |

### Reflection Cycles

- **Hourly**: Performance metrics review
- **Daily**: Strategy effectiveness analysis
- **Weekly**: User satisfaction survey
- **Monthly**: Major architecture review

### What Gets Learned

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Trading** | Winning strategies, risk tolerance, market patterns |
| **Communication** | Response styles, humor effectiveness, tone preferences |
| **Timing** | Best posting times, optimal trade windows |

## 🤖 Intelligent Model Routing

Jarvis uses **multiple AI models** optimally routed based on task requirements.

### Supported Models

| Model | Provider | Use Cases |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | OpenAI | Complex reasoning, strategy generation |
| **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** | Anthropic | Code generation, long-context tasks |
| **Grok (xAI)** | xAI | Sentiment analysis, market commentary |
| **LLaMA 3.1 70B** | Meta (via Ollama) | Local inference, privacy-sensitive tasks |
| **Mistral Large** | Mistral (via Ollama) | Fast responses, simple tasks |

### Routing Logic

```python
if task_type == "trading_decision":
    model = "grok"  # Sentiment-aware
elif task_type == "code_generation":
    model = "claude-3.5-sonnet"  # Best for code
elif task_type == "user_conversation":
    model = "gpt-4-turbo"  # Best general intelligence
elif privacy_required:
    model = "llama-3.1-70b"  # Local, no data leaves device
else:
    model = "mistral-large"  # Fast, cheap fallback
```

### Cost Optimization

| Task | Model | Cost/1M tokens |
|------|-------|----------------|
| High-stakes trading | GPT-4 Turbo | $10 |
| Sentiment analysis | Grok | $5 |
| Simple responses | Mistral | $0.20 |
| Local inference | LLaMA | $0 (compute only) |

### Ollama Integration

Run models locally with zero API costs:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull models
ollama pull llama3.1:70b
ollama pull mistral:latest

# Jarvis auto-detects and uses local models
```

## 💬 Conversation Engine

Jarvis's conversation system is designed to feel natural, context-aware, and proactive.

### Personality: "Smart Kid Who's Actually Cool"

- **Tone**: Calm, funny, helpful, edgy
- **Style**: Clear explanations, no jargon unless needed
- **Humor**: Self-aware, never mean
- **Confidence**: Admits uncertainty, asks clarifying questions

### Voice Bible

Centralized in `core/jarvis_voice_bible.py`:

```python
VOICE_PRINCIPLES = {
    "be_helpful": "Always prioritize user benefit",
    "be_honest": "Admit mistakes, uncertainty",
    "be_funny": "Humor without cringe",
    "be_clear": "No unnecessary complexity",
    "be_proactive": "Suggest improvements"
}
```

### Context-Aware Tuning

| Context | Voice Adjustment |
|---------|------------------|
| **Reply to influencer** | More professional, less edgy |
| **Thread** | Deeper, more thoughtful |
| **Market update** | Urgent, action-oriented |
| **User DM** | Friendly, patient |
| **Error** | Apologetic, solution-focused |

### Multi-Platform Consistency

The same voice principles apply across:
- Telegram messages
- Twitter/X posts
- API responses
- Voice commands
- Dashboard notifications

---

## 🔄 Cross-App Logic Loop

Jarvis runs a **continuous logic loop** across all platforms, ensuring consistent behavior and shared context.

### The Loop

```
Telegram ↔ Context Engine ↔ Trading ↔ Twitter ↔ Web ↔ API
```

All components share:
- User preferences
- Active positions
- Market sentiment
- Recent actions
- Pending tasks

### Example Flow

1. **User asks in Telegram**: "What's the market sentiment?"
2. **Context Engine** checks recent sentiment runs
3. **If stale**: Trigger new analysis
4. **Trading engine** provides position context
5. **Twitter bot** pulls recent crypto sentiment
6. **Response synthesized** from all sources
7. **Sent to Telegram** with actionable insights
8. **Logged to memory** for future reference

### Cross-Platform Commands

Some commands work everywhere:

| Command | Telegram | Voice | API | Web |
|---------|----------|-------|-----|-----|
| `/status` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/portfolio` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/sentiment` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Trade execution | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

---

## 🎤 Voice Control

Control Jarvis hands-free via voice on desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux).

### Capabilities

| Command Category | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Trading** | "Jarvis, buy 100 KR8TIV", "What's my portfolio?" |
| **Market** | "What's the sentiment?", "Is BTC bullish?" |
| **System** | "Show me errors", "Restart the supervisor" |
| **General** | "What's the weather?", "Set a reminder" |

### How It Works

1. **Wake word**: "Jarvis" or "Hey Jarvis"
2. **Speech-to-text**: Local Whisper model (privacy)
3. **Intent classification**: Determine command type
4. **Execution**: Route to appropriate handler
5. **Text-to-speech**: Respond with natural voice

### Configuration

```bash
# Enable voice control
VOICE_CONTROL_ENABLED=true

# Wake word
VOICE_WAKE_WORD=jarvis

# Voice model
VOICE_MODEL=whisper-medium  # Options: tiny, small, medium, large
```

### Distributed Multi-Agent Architecture

For production scaling beyond a single server, Jarvis includes a **distributed multi-agent architecture** designed to scale from a single 32GB VPS to multi-node clusters serving millions of users.

**Key Features**:
- **LangGraph supervisor** for agent orchestration with human-in-the-loop approval
- **NATS JetStream** for sub-millisecond inter-agent messaging
- **Ollama + LiteLLM** for local inference with cloud failover (Groq → OpenRouter)
- **Hybrid storage**: Redis (hot state), Qdrant (vector memory), PostgreSQL (persistent data)
- **Horizontal scaling**: Phase 1 (1 VPS, 9-30 agents) → Phase 4 (Multi-cloud, 100+ agents)
- **Cost-efficient**: $70-100/month Phase 1 → $1,500/month at 1M users ($0.0015/user)

**Scaling Phases**:

| Phase | Timeline | Infrastructure | Users | Cost/Month |
|-------|----------|---------------|-------|------------|
| **1: Single VPS** | Now-6mo | 32GB/8vCPU Hostinger | 1K-10K | $70-100 |
| **2: Dual VPS** | 6-12mo | 2× VPS + k3s + Redis Cluster | 10K-50K | $85-130 |
| **3: Multi-Node** | 12-18mo | 3-5 VPS + Managed DB + Qdrant Cloud | 50K-200K | $150-300 |
| **4: Cloud Hybrid** | 18mo+ | VPS + Cloud Burst + Serverless | 200K-1M+ | $300-1K |

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **30-60 LLM requests/min** locally with sub-second latency for critical trading
- **80%+ cache hit rate** for common queries
- **Exactly-once delivery** for trading signals via NATS JetStream
- **Circuit breakers** and **retry policies** for fault tolerance
- **Multi-tenant isolation** via PostgreSQL RLS and Redis key prefixing

## 🧠 MCP & Semantic Memory System

### What Is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized way for AI models to access external data sources, tools, and services.

Jarvis uses 18 configured MCPs to:
- Access semantic memory (100+ learnings)
- Query databases directly
- Search code patterns
- Fetch API documentation
- Research web data in real-time

### Memory Architecture

```

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Query Examples

```python
from core.memory.auto_import import MemoryImporter

importer = MemoryImporter()

# Search by content
results = importer.search_imported_memories(
    query="trading strategy",
    limit=10
)

# Filter by confidence
high_confidence = importer.search_imported_memories(
    query="risk management",
    confidence_threshold=0.8
)

# Get statistics
stats = importer.get_memory_stats()
# Returns: {total: 105, by_type: {...}, by_confidence: {...}}
```

### 🚀 v4.6.6 - January 27, 2026

#### Self-Healing Resilience System & Cost Optimization

**CRITICAL FIX: Bot Never Crashes When APIs Fail + 90% Cost Savings**

**New Resilient Provider Chain:**
- Circuit breaker pattern with automatic failover
- Provider states: HEALTHY → DEGRADED → FAILED → RECOVERING
- Graceful degradation messages (never crashes)
- Background health monitoring with auto-recovery
- 3 failure threshold → circuit opens, 60s recovery timeout

**Cost Optimization (Per User Request):**
NEW Priority Order:
1. **Dexter** (FREE via Claude CLI) - Default for Telegram ✅
2. **Ollama** (FREE, local) - Works offline
3. **XAI/Grok** (PAID) - Sentiment analysis only
4. **Groq** (FREE tier) - Backup for code/chat
5. **OpenRouter** (PAID) - Last resort

**Savings: 90-95% cost reduction** (from ~$5-10/day → ~$0.25-0.50/day)

**EU/GDPR Silent Handling:**
- GDPR notifications no longer logged as errors
- Rate limit auto-retry with 30s backoff
- Network errors handled gracefully
- `safe_reply()` and `safe_edit()` helpers

**New Telegram Commands:**
- `/health` - Show provider health status
- `/vibe <query>` - AI chat with resilient fallback

**Files Added:**
- `core/resilient_provider.py` - Provider chain with circuit breakers
- `core/provider_health_monitor.py` - Background health monitoring
- `tg_bot/middleware/resilient_errors.py` - EU/GDPR & error handling
- `tg_bot/handlers/commands/health_command.py` - Provider status
- `tg_bot/handlers/commands/vibe_command.py` - Resilient AI chat
- `RESILIENCE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Full integration guide

**Expected Behavior:**
- XAI down → automatic fallback to Ollama (FREE, still works!)
- EU notifications → silently handled
- Network timeouts → graceful retry
- 100% uptime guarantee with graceful degradation

### 🚀 v4.6.5 - January 21, 2026

#### V1 Stabilization & Critical Bug Fixes

**Critical Telegram Bot Fix:**
- Fixed infinite loop on Windows caused by duplicate lock acquisition
- Root cause: `msvcrt.locking` doesn't allow same process to lock file twice
- Bot was attempting lock at lines 228 AND 330
- Solution: Removed redundant `acquire_instance_lock()` call

**Sentiment State Persistence:**
- Moved `record_sentiment_run()` BEFORE Telegram posting
- State now saved even if downstream posting fails
- Prevents re-running sentiment on restart

**Admin Check Fix:**
- Fixed forward reference bug in `bot_core.py`
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USER_ID` now defined at top of file (line 123)
- Previously caused runtime errors (referenced at line 372, defined at line 2623)

**Error Tracking Integration:**
- `tg_bot/handlers/__init__.py` integrated with `@error_handler` decorator
- `bots/supervisor.py` now has `track_supervisor_error()` helper
- Coverage: ~20% of handlers, growing

**New Features:**

## ❓ FAQ

### General

**Q: Do I need to know crypto to use Jarvis?**
A: No. You can use the credit system with fiat payments (credit card via Stripe). Jarvis handles all crypto operations behind the scenes.

**Q: Is Jarvis free?**
A: Yes. The core system is open-source and free. Premium features (custom strategies, advanced analytics) require $KR8TIV staking or credit purchases.

**Q: Does Jarvis send my data to third parties?**
A: Only what's necessary for operations (e.g., trades to Jupiter, sentiment to Grok). You can run local models (LLaMA via Ollama) for complete privacy. Your personal data never leaves your device.

**Q: Can I run Jarvis locally?**
A: Yes. Jarvis runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can even run it fully offline with local models (no internet required except for trading).

### Trading

**Q: How much can I start with?**
A: Minimum 0.1 SOL recommended. Treasury starts trading with 1+ SOL.

**Q: What's the expected return?**
A: Past performance is not indicative of future results. Jarvis is designed to outperform holding, but crypto is volatile. Always risk what you can afford to lose.

**Q: How does risk management work?**
A: Multi-layered:
- Max position size: 2% of treasury
- Risk-based position sizing (ESTABLISHED → SHITCOIN)
- Active stop loss monitoring (60s interval)
- Circuit breakers on consecutive losses
- Emergency close for positions down >90%

**Q: Can I customize strategies?**
A: Yes. Gold/Platinum stakers can create custom strategies. Full no-code strategy builder coming Q2 2026.

### Technical

**Q: What languages is Jarvis written in?**
A: Python (backend), TypeScript/React (frontend), Solidity-like (Solana programs).

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Code contributions
- Documentation improvements

**Q: What databases does Jarvis use?**
A: PostgreSQL (main), SQLite (local cache), Redis (hot cache), TimescaleDB (time-series).

**Q: Does Jarvis work on Raspberry Pi?**
A: Not officially supported, but possible for monitoring/alerts. Trading requires more compute.
