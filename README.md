### 🎤 Voice Control
- **Wake word** — "Hey Jarvis" activates listening
- **Natural conversation** — Chat like you would with a person
- **Hotkey** — Ctrl+Shift+Up for instant access
- **60-second patience** — Won't cut you off mid-thought

### 🖥️ Computer Control
- **Open apps & windows** — "Open Safari", "Switch to VS Code"
- **Compose emails** — "Send an email to John about the meeting"
- **Google searches** — "Search for crypto trading strategies"
- **Create notes & reminders** — "Remind me to call mom at 5pm"
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Copy, paste, save, undo, and more

### 📊 Research & Documents
- **Automated research** — "Research the best AI stocks for 2025"
- **Document creation** — "Create a business plan for my startup"
- **Free software discovery** — "Find open source alternatives to Photoshop"

### 📓 Local Knowledge Engine
- **Distilled note archive** — All notes/research saved as `.md/.txt/.py` in `data/notes/`
- **Auto-summary + prompts** — Every capture creates a concise summary + reusable prompt snippet
- **Command-line + voice parity** — `lifeos capture`, voice `log`, and missions share the same pipeline
- **Raw artifact storage** — curl outputs, transcripts, and CLI logs saved for full traceability

### 👁️ Activity Monitoring
- **App usage tracking** — Know where your time goes
- **Productivity insights** — Identify patterns and distractions
- **Screen context** — Jarvis sees what you see
- **Privacy-first** — All data stays local

### 🔄 Self-Evolution
- **Auto-upgrades on boot** — Applies pending improvements automatically
- **Skill learning** — Add new capabilities via simple Python modules
- **Error analysis** — Learns from failures and fixes itself
- **Continuous iteration** — Gets smarter every day

### 🧩 MCP Autonomy Stack
- **Filesystem + Git MCP** — Safe read/write access to `LifeOS` and Jarvis context with enforced branch discipline.
- **Dual Memory Layer** — JSONL knowledge graph (`server-memory`) plus Obsidian-native graph (`obsidian-memory`) stored in `/Users/burritoaccount/Documents/Obsidian/LifeOSVault`.
- **Knowledge Connectors** — Obsidian REST MCP enables Jarvis to search, edit, and append to vault notes with API-key protection.
- **Systems Insight** — `mcp-monitor` streams CPU/GPU/RAM/network metrics for optimization cycles.
- **Persistent Reasoning** — SQLite MCP hosts long-term structured data and queryable memories.
- **Action Surface** — Shell MCP (sandboxed to LifeOS) and Puppeteer MCP (browser automation) give Jarvis “hands” for executing plans.
- **Sequential Thinking MCP** — Provides scratchpad-style reasoning traces to enforce decomposition before acting.

> The entire MCP stack is declared in `lifeos/config/mcp.config.json`, autostarted by `core/mcp_loader.py`, and mirrored in Windsurf’s `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` for editor parity.

### 🌙 Idle Missions (Auto-Research)
- **MoonDev Watcher** — Tracks official MoonDevOnYT X feed for new HFT drops
- **AlgoTradeCamp Digest** — Snapshots algotradecamp.com for lessons and tactics
- **MoonDev YouTube Harvester** — Pulls transcripts via yt-dlp and summarizes key experiments
- **Self-Improvement Pulse** — Reviews provider errors + memory to prioritize upgrades

### 🔊 Offline Voice
- **Piper TTS** — Bundled model auto-downloads to `data/voices/`, works with no internet
- **Voice fallback** — Seamlessly drops to macOS `say` only if local synthesis fails
- **Configurable** — Customize `voice.tts_engine`, `piper_model`, and `speech_voice` in config

## 📦 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis.git
cd Jarvis

# Set up environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your API key (Gemini, Groq, or OpenAI)
echo '{"google_api_key": "YOUR_KEY", "groq_api_key": "YOUR_GROQ_KEY"}' > secrets/keys.json

# Start Jarvis
./bin/lifeos on --apply

# Talk to Jarvis
./bin/lifeos chat
```

## 🎯 Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `lifeos on --apply` | Start Jarvis daemon |
| `lifeos off --apply` | Stop Jarvis |
| `lifeos status` | Check if Jarvis is running |
| `lifeos chat` | Voice conversation mode |

| `lifeos log "note"` | Quick note to memory |
| `lifeos activity` | View productivity stats |
| `lifeos jarvis research "topic"` | Run research project |
| `lifeos jarvis discover` | System discovery |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `lifeos/config/lifeos.config.json`:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "wake_word": "jarvis",
    "chat_silence_limit": 60,
    "speak_responses": true,
    "tts_engine": "piper",
    "piper_model": "en_US-amy-low.onnx"
  },
  "providers": {
    "gemini": { "enabled": true, "model": "gemini-2.5-pro" },
    "groq": { "enabled": true },
    "ollama": { "enabled": true, "model": "llama3.2:3b" }
  }
}
```

### 🧠 System Instructions

Jarvis follows the memory-first/decomposition/git-safety workflow defined in [`lifeos/config/system_instructions.md`](lifeos/config/system_instructions.md):

1. Query memory MCP servers before asking the user.
2. Break work into steps, logging reasoning and verification.
3. Create/switch feature branches before editing tracked files.
4. Limit filesystem actions to approved LifeOS/Jarvis-context paths and prefer MCP tooling.
5. Record discoveries, blockers, and fixes back into memory for future runs.

## 💰 Cost

| Provider | Cost | Speed | Quality |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| **Groq** | FREE | ⚡ Ultra-fast | Great |
| **Ollama** | FREE | Medium | Good |
| **Gemini** | ~$5-20/mo | Fast | Excellent |
| **OpenAI** | ~$10-30/mo | Fast | Excellent |

## 🛡️ Safety

Jarvis has built-in safety constraints:
- **Cannot delete itself** or critical system files
- **Guardian module** validates all generated code
- **Protected paths** prevent dangerous operations
- **All data local** — nothing sent to external servers (except AI APIs)

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Voice control & wake word
- [x] Computer control (apps, email, search)
- [x] Proactive 15-min suggestions
- [x] Self-evolution system
- [x] Research & document creation
- [ ] Real-time web search
- [ ] Trading automation
- [ ] iOS companion app
- [ ] Multi-device sync

## 📝 Changelog
