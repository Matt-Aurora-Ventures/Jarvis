# Jarvis

Jarvis is a lightweight, self-improving AI assistant that runs locally and responds on demand. It watches what you're doing on screen (when enabled), observes mouse movement, gives suggestions, helps make your life more efficient, and improves itself when you speak to it.

Platform: macOS only right now. It wouldn't take much to make it work on PC.

API cost: It uses an LLM API key (roughly ~$20/month depending on usage).

Future plans: I might build a front end later so anyone can use it across PC or Mac. Even if you don't know how to code, AI can teach you how to run it quickly.

Status: Early, early development. I plan to open-source everything, and you can easily swap in any LLM provider.
