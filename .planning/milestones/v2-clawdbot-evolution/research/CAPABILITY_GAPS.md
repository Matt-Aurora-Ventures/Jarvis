## Executive Summary

Jarvis has a **strong foundation** in autonomous trading, bot orchestration, and multi-platform integration. However, significant gaps exist in:
- **Remote control infrastructure** (requires tunneling/API layer)
- **GUI node system** (completely missing)
- **Dynamic skill system** (basic stub exists, needs full implementation)
- **Advanced reasoning modes** (no structured reasoning levels)
- **Voice/TTS capabilities** (no voice cloning infrastructure)
- **Web automation** (basic browser automation exists, needs Playwright integration)
- **Session management** (no compaction or optimization)
- **Model flexibility** (mostly Claude-focused, lacks provider abstraction)

**Overall Gap Severity:** HIGH  
**Implementation Effort:** 8-12 weeks (with parallel teams)

## Capability Matrix

| Capability | Clawdbot Target | Jarvis Current | Gap | Priority | Effort |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-----|----------|--------|
| **Remote Control** | ✓ (GUI nodes, remote pairing) | ✗ (local only) | CRITICAL | HIGH | LARGE |
| **Skill System** | ✓ (dynamic install/execute) | ~ (basic stub in core/skill_manager.py) | HIGH | HIGH | MEDIUM |
| **Advanced Reasoning** | ✓ (multiple levels) | ✗ (none) | HIGH | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| **Voice/TTS** | ✓ (Qwen3-TTS cloning) | ✗ (none) | MEDIUM | LOW | LARGE |
| **Web Automation** | ✓ (Playwright, full control) | ~ (basic in core/browser_automation.py) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| **Session Management** | ✓ (compact, persist, resume) | ✗ (none) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | SMALL |
| **Model Flexibility** | ✓ (multi-provider routing) | ~ (core/provider_manager.py exists) | LOW | HIGH | SMALL |
| **MCP Integration** | ✓ (native, comprehensive) | ✓ (core/mcp_loader.py operational) | LOW | LOW | SMALL |
| **Command System** | ✓ (slash commands) | ✓ (tg_bot/commands.py + handlers) | NONE | N/A | N/A |
| **Subagent Management** | ✓ (list/stop/log) | ✓ (bots/supervisor.py with health monitoring) | NONE | N/A | N/A |
