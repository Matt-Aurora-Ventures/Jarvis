# Phase 04: CI/CD Automation - Plan 01 (Deployment Triggers)

## Objective
Update the GitHub CI/CD Actions to satisfy continuous deployments.

## Context
Deploying trading bots automatically requires high confidence. The user roadmap mentions pushing `jarvislife.cloud` and `kr8tiv.web.app` automatically, driven by tests. We have identified existing `jarvis-sniper-firebase-deploy.yml` and `deploy.yml`.

## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Un-Gate Production Docker Pushes
- **Objective:** Allow the main Python ecosystem to deploy to production actively, removing the manual block.
- **Action:**
  - Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - Modify the `deploy-production` job to trigger automatically on `push: branches: [main]` instead of keeping it strictly to `release` or `workflow_dispatch`.

### Task 2: Standardize Firebase Tuning Deploy
- **Objective:** Optimize how Firebase receives updates.
- **Action:**
  - Verify that `jarvis-sniper-firebase-deploy.yml` successfully publishes to the correct frontend URL.
  - Implement a check to trigger deployment specifically only when paths in `jarvis-sniper` or `core` (e.g. strategy maps) update.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- We cannot execute GitHub workflows entirely locally in the same manner. This stage involves modifying the `.yml` files on disk securely. The success state is clean formatting for pushed branches.
