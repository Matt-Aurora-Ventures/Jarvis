- Generated: 2026-02-12T18:57:43-06:00
- Scope: live smoke nav + cloud log digest + session-vs-chain reconciliation

## Browser Smoke (Live Firebase)

- URL: https://kr8tiv.web.app
- Navigation checkpoints captured: 6
- Console errors: 0
- Console warnings: 0
- Artifacts: .jarvis-cache/playwright-smoke/

## Cloud Digest

- Source: debug/cloud-log-digest-20260212-185343.md
- Summary: no recent 5xx/error spikes in sampled window.

## On-chain Reconciliation

- Source: debug/debug-report-2026-02-13T00-54-12-080Z.md
- Wallet snapshot captured successfully.
- Note: session markdown did not contain full tx signatures to verify directly (0 extracted).

## Findings

- Auto continuity paths now stay alive across route switches in smoke navigation.
- No browser console errors surfaced during the live route-switch smoke run.
- No sampled Cloud Run error spikes in the digest window.
- Additional session reports should include full tx signatures for direct claim-vs-chain verification.
