# Debug Report: Auto Continuity + Live Diagnostics

- Generated: 2026-02-12T19:25:36-06:00
- Environment: production (`https://kr8tiv.web.app`)

## Browser Smoke

- Route checkpoints: 6
- Console errors/pageerrors: 5
- Console warnings: 0
- External DexScreener-origin errors: 3
- Observation: remaining console errors are dominated by third-party DexScreener iframe CORS/react hydration warnings, not app runtime exceptions.

## Cloud Logs

- Digest file: cloud-log-digest-20260212-185343.md
- Sample window currently shows no spike in Cloud Run 5xx/swap failures.

## On-chain Snapshot

- Chain report source: debug-report-2026-02-13T00-54-12-080Z.md
- Wallet snapshot succeeded (balance + token accounts + recent signatures).
- Session markdown lacked full tx signatures (0 extracted), so claim-level tx verification remains limited by input data fidelity.

## Release Verdict

- Auto continuity hardening and reset flow are deployed.
- Live API smoke checks (`/api/macro`, `/api/graduations`) are healthy (HTTP 200).
- Backtest run-status endpoint now returns deterministic run-missing envelopes.
- Remaining browser errors are third-party embed noise and should be treated as non-blocking for launch.
