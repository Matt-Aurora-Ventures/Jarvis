# Notebook LM Context (Sanitized)

This file was sanitized for security.

Removed:
- Detailed sniper execution/runtime behavior
- Operational integration specifics
- Trade and control-flow internals that should remain private

Public-safe note:
- NotebookLM-assisted context is still supported internally.
- Detailed operational documentation is maintained in private internal systems.
