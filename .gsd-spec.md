# Jarvis Project V1 - Comprehensive Analysis & Implementation

## Project Overview
Jarvis is an autonomous LifeOS trading and AI assistant system running on Solana with Telegram and X/Twitter integration.

## Current State
- Database: Heavy, needs analysis and optimization
- `/demo` trading bot: Trade execution failures (PRD exists)
- `/vibe` command: Not yet implemented for Telegram
- Multiple bot components: Treasury, Telegram, Twitter/X, Buy Tracker, Bags Intel

## Goals

### 1. Database Analysis
**Objective**: Comprehensive analysis of database structure, performance, and optimization opportunities

**Deliverables**:
- Schema documentation
- Performance bottlenecks
- Optimization recommendations
- Migration plan if needed

### 2. Fix `/demo` Trading Bot
**Objective**: Resolve trade execution failures and implement V1 per PRD

**Known Issues**:
- Trade execution failures
- Message handler registration issues
- Wallet initialization problems
- Charts non-functional
- Advanced orders missing (stop-loss, take-profit)

**Reference**: `prd-demo-bot-enhancement.md`

**Deliverables**:

- Response formatting

**Deliverables**:
- Working `/vibe` command
- Documentation
- Safety guardrails

### 4. Gap Analysis & V1 Roadmap
**Objective**: Identify all gaps, loops, and create clear V1 path

**Deliverables**:
- Complete gap analysis
- Prioritized roadmap
- Implementation phases
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates

## Success Criteria
- Database optimized and documented
- `/demo` bot fully functional with all PRD features
- `/vibe` command working from Telegram
- Clear V1 roadmap with no critical gaps
- All critical bugs fixed
- Public launch ready

## Constraints
- Must maintain existing functionality
- No breaking changes to live bots
- Security and safety first
- Performance must improve, not degrade
