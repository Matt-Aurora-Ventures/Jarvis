## THE PROMPT (Copy this into invideo AI)

Create a 60-second product launch video for Jarvis LifeOS, an AI-powered autonomous trading assistant for Solana.

**Website:** jarvislife.io

**Brand Visual Style:**
- Color scheme: Electric neon green (#39FF14) accents on dark backgrounds with pure white text
- Futuristic, glassmorphic design with glowing borders and subtle grid overlays
- High-tech but grounded aesthetic - luminous modernism, not cartoonish
- Typography: Bold Clash Display headlines with DM Sans body text
- Visual metaphors: operating system interfaces, sci-fi command centers, glowing data streams

**Video Type:** Product demo + explainer hybrid for fintech SaaS

**Tone & Feel:**
Premium, powerful, technically credible, slightly rebellious. Direct and audacious without hype. The vibe is "this is real tech that works" not "get rich quick scheme."

**Music:**
Deep, cinematic electronic soundtrack. Starts mysterious and builds to energetic. Think: Blade Runner meets trading floor intensity. Heavy bass, atmospheric pads, crisp percussion. NOT upbeat pop - we want sophisticated tension.

**Voiceover:**
Deep British male voice. Confident, measured, authoritative. Not shouting or hyped - think documentary narrator who knows secrets. Pace should be deliberate with dramatic pauses.

**Visual Structure:**

HOOK (0-8 seconds):
- Open on electric green code scrolling rapidly on dark terminal
- Quick cuts: trading charts, Solana logo glowing, command line interface
- Text overlay in Clash Display font: "JARVIS IS NOT A CHATBOT"
- Voiceover: "What if your trading assistant never slept?"

PROBLEM AGITATION (8-20 seconds):
- Show frustrated trader missing opportunities, charts moving while they're away
- Cloud service outage notices, privacy breach headlines
- Text overlays: "Cloud Surveillance," "Missed Trades," "Zero Privacy"
- Split screen: centralized exchange going down vs. Jarvis running locally
- Voiceover: "Every second you're offline, opportunities vanish. Every cloud service you trust, someone's watching."

SOLUTION INTRODUCTION (20-35 seconds):
- Jarvis interface materializes - glassmorphic cards with glowing green borders
- Show Telegram bot executing trades instantly
- Dashboard displays: "99.2% Success Rate," "271 Commits," "1200+ Tests Passing"
- Highlight key features with smooth transitions:
  * "Local Intelligence. Zero Cloud Surveillance."
  * "Solana-Native Speed. Jupiter DEX Routing."
  * "Mandatory TP/SL. Jito MEV Protection."
  * "Autonomous 24/7. Never Misses a Beat."
- Show split screen: web interface (port 5001) + Telegram interface side-by-side
- Voiceover: "Jarvis is your LifeOS. It runs locally, trades autonomously, and never stops learning."

PROOF & CREDIBILITY (35-50 seconds):
- Terminal output showing: "Coverage: 94.67%," "V1: 100% Complete"
- GitHub commit graph visualization with electric green activity bars
- Quick montage of real features:
  * /demo command in Telegram executing a buy with TP/SL
  * Position tracking in real-time
  * Bags.fm integration showing graduation analysis
  * Web trading interface with portfolio P&L
- Text overlays: "Open Source," "Battle-Tested," "Community-Aligned"
- Code snippets briefly visible showing Python/TypeScript (adds technical credibility)
- Voiceover: "Built in public. Debugged in real-time. Every commit tracked. Every test passing. This isn't vaporware."

CALL TO ACTION (50-60 seconds):
- Pull back to full Jarvis dashboard glowing with activity
- jarvislife.io domain prominently displayed with electric green glow
- Text overlay: "JOIN THE WAITLIST"
- Secondary text: "Built by humans + Claude. Shipped with receipts."
- Final frame: Jarvis logo pulsing with tagline "YOUR LIFEOS. YOUR RULES."
- Voiceover: "Ready to stop missing opportunities? Jarvis awaits. Visit jarvislife.io."

**Text Overlays (exact copy):**
- "JARVIS IS NOT A CHATBOT. IT'S YOUR LIFEOS."
- "Local Intelligence. Zero Surveillance."
- "99.2% Swap Success Rate"
- "94.67% Test Coverage"
- "1200+ Tests Passing"
- "V1: 100% Complete"
- "Open Source. Battle-Tested."
- "jarvislife.io"
- "Built by humans + Claude"

**Visual Effects:**
- Use glowing particle effects in electric green
- Terminal-style text animations (typing effect)
- Smooth glassmorphic card transitions
- Grid overlays and geometric wireframes
- Data streams and animated graphs
- Subtle chromatic aberration on key moments
- Depth of field with focus pulls on important UI elements

**FINAL TIP:** invideo AI responds best to natural language. Read the prompt aloud - if it sounds like you're briefing a video producer colleague, you're on the right track. If it sounds robotic or overly technical, simplify.

The key is balancing **enough detail** (so AI understands your vision) with **natural flow** (so it doesn't get confused by contradictions or jargon).

Good luck! 🎬⚡
