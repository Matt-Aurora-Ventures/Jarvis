## Overview

$KR8TIV is the currency of attention, value, and participation in the Jarvis LifeOS ecosystem. It's designed to align incentives between users, holders, and developers while maintaining the open-source ethos that makes Jarvis accessible to everyone.

## Token Distribution

### Revenue Allocation
