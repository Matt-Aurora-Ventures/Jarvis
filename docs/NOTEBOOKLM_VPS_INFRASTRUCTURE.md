# NotebookLM Infrastructure (Sanitized)

This document was intentionally sanitized and moved out of the public repository because it previously contained operational runtime details.

Removed content categories:
- Live infrastructure endpoints and host addresses
- Bot/runtime deployment topology
- Token/env naming that could aid operational targeting
- Incident-response internals tied to active runtime behavior

Current policy:
1. NotebookLM operational runbooks and runtime mappings are private-only.
2. Public docs may describe architecture at a high level but must not include deploy-time details.
3. Secrets, token names, hostnames/IPs, and command/control specifics are prohibited in public docs.

If you need access, use the internal operations vault/runbook set and the private incident channel.
