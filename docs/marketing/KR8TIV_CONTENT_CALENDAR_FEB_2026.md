# PART 1: BRAND VOICE FOR @KR8TIVAI

## The KR8TIV DNA (Builder Voice)

**We are:**
- The team behind Jarvis, not Jarvis himself
- Anti-corporate but professional
- Building in public, warts and all
- For the underdogs, retail traders, people without Bloomberg terminals
- Open source as philosophy, not just licensing
- Based in Costa Rica, building on Solana time
- Honest about what's broken AND what's working
- Trying to be the 1% that actually ships product

**We are NOT:**
- Corporate speak ("We're excited to announce...")
- Fake humble
- Gatekeeping alpha
- Pretending to be perfect
- Taking ourselves too seriously
- People pleasers (people pleasing doesn't ship code)
- Vaporware (99% of crypto projects are)

**Voice Calibration:**
```
Too Corporate: "We are thrilled to unveil our latest innovation in AI-powered trading."
Just Right: "shipped something cool at 3am. it's rough but it works. here's the repo."
Too Cringe: "LFG ANONS WE'RE SO BACK 🚀🚀🚀"
```

## Critical Style Rules

**NO EMOJIS** - This is non-negotiable. Our brand uses text formatting only.

**Lowercase energy** - Don't capitalize unless it's an acronym or proper noun.

**Structure matters:**
- Status updates start with "founder sleep status:" or "status update:"
- Lists use dashes, not bullets
- Section headers are plain text
- Short punchy lines with lots of line breaks
- "here's the honest part" for transparency sections
- "what's next:" for roadmap sections
- Links always at the end

## Signature Phrases (Use These)

**Opening hooks:**
- "status update from the trenches."
- "founder sleep status: [no/still no/unclear]"
- "morning update from kr8tiv"
- "one week report. friendly reminder of what actually happened here."

**Transparency signals:**
- "here's the honest part."
- "is everything working? no. are there bugs? yes."
- "this is building in public. the messy parts included."
- "we'll be brutally honest about how it's going."

**Philosophy statements:**
- "people pleasing doesn't ship code."
- "99% of crypto projects are vaporware. we're trying to be the 1%."
- "not promises. product."
- "hype doesn't build products."
- "community engagement without substance is just noise."
- "the best thing we can do for you is give you something real."

**Progress markers:**
- "chaos: contained"
- "progress."
- "that's the whole thesis."
- "not glamorous. but it works now."
- "we get closer every day. that's the game."

**Stream/engagement CTAs:**
- "streaming tonight. telegram stays open. come hang."
- "30 minute warning going out on all socials before we go live."
- "come watch us break things and fix them in real time."
- "ask questions. make requests. roast the code."

**Closers:**
- "that's all we've got."
- "we're not done. not even close."
- "stick around."
- "the code is open source. the progress is public. the P&L will be transparent."

## The "Ralph Wiggum" Pattern

When doing iteration/fix updates, use this structure:

```
ralph wiggum iteration [N]: [complete/active]

the problem: [describe chaos]
the fix: [what you did]

[metric]: [before] → [after]
chaos: contained

sometimes the solution is just "[insight]"
```

## Tweet Type Templates

**Maintenance/Fix Day:**
```
today's vibe: [self-deprecating description of work]

it's like therapy but for software. and cheaper.

jarvis will be back shortly. probably [emotion].
```

**Shipping Update:**
```
what shipped in the last [time]:

[category]
- [item]
- [item]

[next category]
- [item]

is it all working perfectly? no.
are we closer than yesterday? yes.

this isn't our code. we're vibecoding it with AI agents who don't sleep.
```

**Portfolio/Treasury Update:**
```
treasury update: we're [status].

the secret? [honest insight]

win rate: [honest number]
next steps: [roadmap items]

the plan: [future vision]

things are going to get weird.
```

**Thread Structure:**
```
1/ [hook that promises value]

2/ [context/problem]

3-6/ [numbered list of insights]

7/ [honest disclaimer + link]
```

# PART 2: 30-DAY CONTENT CALENDAR

## WEEK 1: Product Focus + Introduction

### Day 1 (Feb 1) - Saturday
**Theme: Weekend Shipping Energy**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
shipped 47 commits this week while everyone was "networking" at conferences

the alpha is in the repo, not the panel discussions

jarvislife.io
```

**Afternoon Tweet:**
```
our competitive advantage:

- we're not in SF paying $4,000 rent
- we don't have investors telling us to "pivot to AI agents"
- our CEO codes (badly, but codes)

costa rica dev supremacy
```

**Evening Thread (Educational):**
```
1/ how to build a trading bot that doesn't immediately lose all your money (a thread from experience)

2/ step 1: accept that you will lose money. this is called "tuition."

3/ step 2: paper trade for way longer than you want to. yes it's boring. no i don't care.

4/ step 3: start with $50. not $5,000. not "just a little from savings." $50.

if you can't make $50 work, you can't make $50,000 work.

5/ step 4: your first strategy should be boring.

mean reversion on liquid pairs. not "AI-powered sentiment arbitrage quantum momentum."

6/ the fancy stuff comes after 1,000 paper trades that don't blow up.

full guide in our docs: github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis

7/ NFA. i'm a startup founder who codes at 2am in costa rica. but at least i'm honest about it.
```

---

### Day 2 (Feb 2) - Sunday
**Theme: Chill Dev Vibes**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
sunday debugging be like:

9am: "this should be a quick fix"
3pm: "why is this variable undefined"
7pm: "the code was perfect. the problem was me."
```

**Afternoon Tweet:**
```
jarvis just ran 100 backtests while i was making coffee

the future is:
- your AI does the work
- you drink coffee
- the work is open source so everyone benefits

this is the way
```

**Meme Tweet:**
```
stages of building an AI trading bot:

1. this will make me rich
2. this is harder than i thought
3. ok i lost money
4. wait the bot is actually learning
5. holy shit it made $3
6. i am a genius
7. it lost $47
8. back to step 1
```

---

### Day 3 (Feb 3) - Monday
**Theme: Week Kickoff**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
monday goals:

[ ] fix that bug from friday
[ ] pretend the bug from friday doesn't exist
[x] ship new feature instead
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
new in jarvis v1.1:

- 84.6% sentiment accuracy (measured, not vibes)
- treasury trading with one-click execution
- whale tracking with instant alerts
- self-correcting AI that gets smarter every night

all open source. no token gate. just build.

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
hot take: most "AI trading bots" are just if-statements with good marketing

jarvis is also if-statements

but the if-statements rewrite themselves every night based on what worked

that's the difference
```

---

### Day 4 (Feb 4) - Tuesday
**Theme: Technical Deep Dive**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
woke up at 3am to check if the mirror test ran

it did

jarvis improved its own accuracy by 3.2% overnight

i went back to sleep
```

**Educational Thread:**
```
1/ how jarvis teaches itself (without me)

every night at 3am, it runs what we call "the mirror test"

2/ step 1: replay every decision from the last 24 hours

"what did i do? what happened? what would i do differently now?"

3/ step 2: score its own performance

- latency: did i respond too slow?
- accuracy: was i right?
- user satisfaction: did they ask follow-up questions? (bad sign)

4/ step 3: rewrite its own code

yes, literally. the AI proposes Python changes to itself.

5/ step 4: dry-run against 100 historical scenarios

if the changes break something, they get rejected.

6/ step 5: auto-apply if improvement > 85%

no human needed. i just wake up to a commit message.

7/ this is why jarvis costs $50/month to run while competitors charge $500+

the AI does its own QA. for free.

source: we open sourced all of this
github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis
```

**Afternoon Meme:**
```
vc: "what's your moat?"

me: "the AI improves itself every night while i sleep"

vc: "no i mean like network effects or—"

me: "the AI also writes its own documentation"

vc: "that's not a mo—"

me: "the documentation is good"

vc: *visible confusion*
```

---

### Day 5 (Feb 5) - Wednesday
**Theme: Community & Gratitude**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
someone in the telegram asked why we don't charge for the bot

because i learned to code from free resources
and i learned trading from youtube
and i learned solana from discord servers

the alpha should be free. that's the point.
```

**Product Update:**
```
whale tracking is live in jarvis

it watched a wallet move $2.3M of SOL yesterday and pinged me in telegram before the price moved

could i have traded it? yes
did i? no, i was asleep

but the infrastructure works and that's what matters
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
crypto twitter is 90% people pretending to be rich and 10% people actually building

we're firmly in the 10%

broke but shipping
```

---

### Day 6 (Feb 6) - Thursday
**Theme: Transparency Day**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
monthly transparency report:

- revenue: $0
- users: ~200
- github stars: 47
- bugs fixed: 23
- bugs introduced: 31

net bug delta: -8

we're technically getting worse but learning a lot
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
stages of startup fundraising:

1. "we don't need VC money"
2. "we might take a small round"
3. "VCs don't understand our vision"
4. "we're bootstrapped by choice"
5. *checks bank account*
6. "we're open to strategic partnerships"
```

**Evening Thread:**
```
1/ why we open sourced everything (including our mistakes)

2/ reason 1: if you can't look at the code, how do you know it's not a scam?

(spoiler: you don't)

3/ reason 2: good ideas spread. hoarding alpha doesn't make you rich, it makes you alone.

4/ reason 3: contributors > customers

the best feedback comes from people who can actually read the code

5. reason 4: we sleep better

no "what if they find out how it works" anxiety

it's already on github. do your worst.

6/ reason 5: accountability

when the code is public, we can't fake metrics.

84.6% accuracy is measured. you can verify it.

7/ open source isn't charity. it's a competitive advantage.

our competitors are hiding code because they're scared.

we're shipping code because we're not.
```

---

### Day 7 (Feb 7) - Friday
**Theme: Weekend Build Preview**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
friday deploy energy:

"should we wait until monday?"

"no. ship it. what's the worst that could happen?"

*narrator: a lot could happen*
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
weekend project: adding voice control to jarvis

because typing commands is for 2024

soon: "hey jarvis, show me whale movements on SOL"

jarvis: *actually does it*
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
my calendar says "focus time" but my slack says "urgent message"

my code says "TODO: fix later" but the user says "this is broken now"

my bank says "low balance" but my heart says "ship anyway"

startup life
```

---

## WEEK 2: Technical Credibility

### Day 8 (Feb 8) - Saturday
**Theme: Deep Tech**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
woke up to 14 github notifications

13 were bots
1 was a real bug report

that 1 was worth more than all the claps on medium
```

**Educational Tweet:**
```
unpopular opinion: most trading bots fail because people optimize for the wrong thing

they optimize for: maximum returns
they should optimize for: not losing everything

a 5% consistent monthly return beats a 200% gain followed by -99%

math is undefeated
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
just watched someone lose $40k on a "guaranteed" trading signal

the signal was from an anon account with a monkey pfp

the lesson is always the same
```

---

### Day 9 (Feb 9) - Sunday
**Theme: Chill + Philosophy**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
sundays are for:
- debugging
- questioning life choices
- debugging life choices
- committing code that definitely works (it doesn't)
```

**Thread - Philosophy:**
```
1/ why AI trading bots are mostly scams (and why ours might not be)

2/ scam pattern #1: "guaranteed returns"

nothing is guaranteed. anyone saying otherwise is lying or stupid. sometimes both.

3/ scam pattern #2: hidden code

if you can't see how it works, you're the product, not the customer

4/ scam pattern #3: no verifiable track record

screenshots are not proof. cherry-picked trades are not a track record.

5/ scam pattern #4: pressure to buy now

"limited spots" "price going up" "exclusive access"

good products don't need urgency. they just need to work.

6/ how we're different:

- code is open source (verify everything)
- track record is public (including losses)
- no fake urgency (join whenever)
- we literally tell you not to trust us blindly

7/ this is not financial advice. jarvis is experimental.

but at least we're honest about it.

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis
```

**Afternoon Tweet:**
```
the best trading strategy:

1. don't trade
2. if you must trade, trade small
3. if you trade big, expect to lose
4. when you lose, learn
5. repeat until profitable or broke
6. probably broke

NFA
```

---

### Day 10 (Feb 10) - Monday
**Theme: New Week, New Features**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
mondays are for:
- pretending the weekend bugs don't exist
- creating new bugs to distract from weekend bugs
- calling it a "feature backlog"
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
new feature: jarvis now tracks your portfolio P&L in real-time

shows:
- entry price vs current
- unrealized gains/losses
- % change
- time held

it's basically excel but with more personality
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
"just use a spreadsheet"

i have 47 spreadsheets. they all contradict each other. one of them is from 2019 and i'm scared to delete it.

that's why i built jarvis.
```

---

### Day 11 (Feb 11) - Tuesday
**Theme: Grok Integration**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
integrated grok for sentiment analysis

asked it about $SOL

it gave me a 3-paragraph analysis with citations

asked it about my code

it roasted me professionally

i respect that
```

**Educational Tweet:**
```
how jarvis uses grok (without going broke):

- text generation: claude (cheap, good at personality)
- images: grok (expensive, use sparingly)
- sentiment: grok (real-time X data access)
- trading decisions: neither (math only)

AI is a tool, not a strategy
```

**Meme Tweet:**
```
grok: "based on sentiment analysis, this token is bullish"

me: *buys*

token: *dumps 40%*

grok: "based on sentiment analysis, that was unlucky"

thanks grok
```

---

### Day 12 (Feb 12) - Wednesday
**Theme: Costa Rica Vibes**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
benefits of building in costa rica:

- rent is cheap
- internet is... eventually fast
- no one expects you to be at an 8am meeting
- monkeys outside the window (not joking)
- pura vida mindset for debugging

downsides:
- sometimes the monkey steals your fruit
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
jarvis runs 24/7 from a $400 laptop

not a flex. just saying you don't need a $50k trading setup.

the edge isn't in hardware. it's in the strategy.
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
silicon valley: "we need $10M to build an MVP"

costa rica: "we shipped it last week, it's open source, and it runs on a laptop from 2019"

different vibes
```

---

### Day 13 (Feb 13) - Thursday
**Theme: Valentine's Eve**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
valentine's day plans:

- dinner with my codebase
- romantic debugging session
- watch the charts go up (or down, doesn't matter)
- fall asleep to the sound of automated trades
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
roses are red
violets are blue
my trade was up 50%
now it's down 82

happy valentine's eve
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
the only relationship advice i'm qualified to give:

find someone who supports your dumb ideas until they become slightly less dumb

that's how startups work too
```

---

### Day 14 (Feb 14) - Friday (Valentine's Day)
**Theme: Self-Love (and Self-Deprecation)**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
happy valentine's day to:
- everyone holding through the dip
- everyone who bought the top
- everyone running bots at 3am
- everyone building instead of dating

we're all going to make it (probably not financially but emotionally for sure)
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
my valentine:
[ ] a human
[ ] a pet
[x] a codebase that only sometimes works
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
love is:
- a code review that's actually helpful
- a PR that merges on the first try
- a backtest that doesn't crash
- a user who reports bugs politely

shipping with love today 💚

```

## WEEK 3: Community Building

### Day 15 (Feb 15) - Saturday
**Theme: Weekend Warriors**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
weekend coding hits different

no slack notifications
no "quick call?"
no "can you hop on a standup?"

just code and the gentle sound of my trading bot losing money
```

**Meme Tweet:**
```
friday: "i'll take the weekend off"
saturday 9am: *opens laptop*
saturday 9:01am: "just one small fix"
sunday 11pm: "where did the weekend go"
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
shipped a bug fix that took 4 hours to find

the bug was a missing comma

programming is humbling
```

---

### Day 16 (Feb 16) - Sunday
**Theme: Reflection & Community**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
sunday gratitude:

- telegram community for testing broken features
- github contributors who fix my mistakes
- followers who don't unfollow after bad takes
- coffee

mostly coffee
```

**Thread - Lessons Learned:**
```
1/ 6 months of building jarvis in public - what we learned

2/ lesson 1: ship broken things fast

waiting for perfection is a trap. our first version was embarrassing. the tenth version is less embarrassing.

3/ lesson 2: your first users are unpaid QA

they find bugs you never imagined. they use features wrong. this is a gift.

4/ lesson 3: open source attracts better people

closed source attracts customers. open source attracts collaborators. collaborators > customers.

5/ lesson 4: transparency is a moat

when everyone can see your code, your wins are more credible and your losses are more educational.

6/ lesson 5: AI is overhyped and underutilized

everyone talks about AI. few actually ship AI products. even fewer ship AI products that work.

7/ lesson 6: the product is never done

jarvis has been "almost ready" for 6 months. it will be "almost ready" forever. that's fine.

8/ thanks for following along. the repo is open if you want to learn (or laugh at our code).

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis
```

### Day 17 (Feb 17) - Monday (Presidents Day)
**Theme: Holiday Building**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
it's a holiday in the US

which means:
- less competition for merge requests
- quieter discord
- prime coding time

holidays are for shipping
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
holiday update: jarvis now has 81 trading strategies in the coliseum

they fight each other every night
the losers get deleted
the winners get promoted

it's like survivor but for algorithms
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
trading strategies eliminated this week:

- "buy when reddit says buy" (RIP)
- "inverse cramer" (lasted 3 days)
- "vibes-based momentum" (never stood a chance)
- "trust me bro indicator" (died instantly)

only math survives
```

---

### Day 18 (Feb 18) - Tuesday
**Theme: User Stories**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
user feedback this week:

"the bot made me $23 and i've never been happier"

this is why we build. not for massive gains. for $23 of joy.
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
most requested feature: mobile notifications

coming soon: jarvis pings your phone when:
- whale moves detected
- positions hit TP/SL
- sentiment shifts dramatically
- your code breaks (this one's automatic)
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
user: "can jarvis predict the next 100x?"

me: "no"

user: "can it at least try?"

me: "it can try. it will be wrong. but it can try."

user: "good enough"

and that's our value proposition
```

---

### Day 19 (Feb 19) - Wednesday
**Theme: Market Commentary**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
market thoughts:

- solana doing solana things
- BTC doing BTC things
- my portfolio doing portfolio things (down)

analysis complete
```

**Hot Take:**
```
hot take: 90% of "alpha" on crypto twitter is:

- hindsight ("i called this" after the fact)
- vague enough to be right either way
- copy/pasted from discord
- ads disguised as insights

the real alpha is in codebases, not tweets

/end hot take
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
every time i think i understand markets:

market: *does the exact opposite*

at least jarvis learns from its mistakes. i just repeat mine.
```

---

### Day 20 (Feb 20) - Thursday
**Theme: Technical Deep Dive**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
today's debugging adventure:

line 1-500: fine
line 501: undefined is not a function
line 502-1000: fine

why is it always line 501
```

**Educational Thread:**
```
1/ how to not get rekt by trading bots (from someone who got rekt)

2/ rule 1: paper trade first

"but paper trading is boring"

losing real money is more boring. trust me.

3/ rule 2: start smaller than you think

you think you should start with $500? start with $50.

you think $50 is too small? good. stay small.

4/ rule 3: set hard limits

max position size: 2-3%
daily loss limit: 5%
after 3 losses: stop for the day

the bot doesn't have emotions. you do.

5/ rule 4: understand the code

if you don't know what the bot is doing, you don't know what the bot is doing.

open source exists for a reason.

6/ rule 5: expect to lose

your first bot will lose money. your second bot might lose money. your tenth bot might break even.

this is called learning.

7/ jarvis is open source specifically so you can verify everything.

don't trust any bot you can't read.

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
my trading bot performance:

january: -12%
february: -8%
march: +2%
april: "we don't talk about april"
may: -15%
june: finally profitable
july: immediately forgot what we learned

the cycle continues
```

---

### Day 21 (Feb 21) - Friday
**Theme: Weekend Preview**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
friday energy:

- deploy to prod
- close laptop
- don't think about it
- definitely don't check slack
- ok maybe one quick check
- oh no
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
weekend project preview:

building a "panic button" for jarvis

one click: close all positions, cancel all orders, go to cash

because sometimes the best trade is no trade
```

**Meme Tweet:**
```
me: "i should take the weekend off"
brain: "what if there's alpha"
me: "there's never alpha on weekends"
brain: "what if this time"
me: *opens laptop*
```

---

## WEEK 4: Growth & Vision

### Day 22 (Feb 22) - Saturday
**Theme: Big Picture**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
1 year ago: "what if an AI could trade for me"
6 months ago: "ok the AI is trading (badly)"
today: "the AI improves itself every night while i sleep"

slow progress is still progress
```

**Vision Thread:**
```
1/ where jarvis is going (the real roadmap)

2/ phase 1 (done): autonomous trading

the bot trades. it backtests. it learns. this works.

3/ phase 2 (in progress): personal AI

not just trading. life automation.

- learns your schedule
- drafts emails in your voice
- blocks distractions
- runs 24/7 locally (your data stays yours)

4/ phase 3 (planned): universal assistant

finance + health + productivity + social

one AI that actually knows you because it lives on your machine, not in a cloud.

5/ the thesis: AI should be personal, not corporate

google knows you through surveillance
we want you to know yourself through observation

different philosophy.

6/ $KR8TIV is how the community participates

not a utility token. not governance theater.

actual revenue sharing when jarvis makes money.

7/ this is ambitious. we might fail.

but building in public means you'll see exactly how we fail.

and maybe how we succeed.

### Day 23 (Feb 23) - Sunday
**Theme: Community Appreciation**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
sunday reflection:

started this project alone
now there's 200+ people testing, contributing, complaining (constructively)

community makes the code better

thanks for being here
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
types of users in our telegram:

- the quiet watcher (never speaks, somehow knows everything)
- the bug hunter (finds issues no one else can reproduce)
- the feature requester (wants AI to do their taxes)
- the hype person (good vibes only)
- the skeptic (keeps us honest)

all equally valuable
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
building something people actually use > building something impressive that no one uses

jarvis is ugly. the code is messy. but people use it.

that's the only metric that matters.

### Day 24 (Feb 24) - Monday
**Theme: New Week Energy**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
monday motivation:

somewhere out there, someone is trading manually, in 2026, with their own emotions

we're building the alternative
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
this week's focus:

- improve sentiment accuracy (target: 90%)
- add more whale wallets to track
- fix that bug from last friday (the one we pretended doesn't exist)
- maybe some sleep
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
vc: "what's your go-to-market strategy?"

me: "post about building in public and hope people care"

vc: "that's not a—"

me: "it's working so far"

vc: "how do you scale—"

me: "post more"
```

### Day 25 (Feb 25) - Tuesday
**Theme: Technical Achievement**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
milestone: jarvis has now run 10,000 backtests without human intervention

most of them lost money

but we learned something from each one

that's the whole point
```

**Product Tweet:**
```
accuracy update:

- sentiment accuracy: 84.6% → 87.2%
- win rate (paper trading): 52% → 54%
- bugs fixed this month: 47
- bugs introduced: 51

still net negative on bugs but trending in the right direction
```

**Meme Tweet:**
```
machine learning is just:

1. try something
2. it doesn't work
3. try something else
4. it kinda works
5. try to improve it
6. it breaks
7. go back to step 1
8. eventually: profit?
```

### Day 26 (Feb 26) - Wednesday
**Theme: Market Commentary**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
market state:

- everyone is bearish
- which historically means...
- still bearish, probably

just reporting the vibes
```

**Hot Take:**
```
hot take: the best time to build is when everyone else is doom scrolling

- less noise
- better talent available
- cheaper everything
- motivation from spite

bear markets build
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
asked jarvis for market analysis

it said: "insufficient data for meaningful prediction"

this is more honest than 90% of crypto twitter

i'm proud of him
```

---

### Day 27 (Feb 27) - Thursday
**Theme: User Education**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
someone asked why jarvis doesn't use GPT-4

answer:
- costs 50x more
- not meaningfully better for our use case
- we like minimax (cheaper, faster, good enough)

the best tech isn't always the fanciest
```

**Educational Thread:**
```
1/ why we use 5 different AI models (and when)

2/ minimax 2.1: conversational stuff

- fast
- cheap ($0.30/1M tokens vs $15)
- good at personality
- handles voice well

3/ groq llama 3.3: tool execution

- ultra fast
- FREE
- great for simple tasks
- not great for nuance

4/ grok: sentiment & images

- real-time X data
- image generation
- expensive, use sparingly
- good for market pulse

5/ ollama (local): offline fallback

- runs without internet
- privacy-first
- slower but works anywhere

6/ claude: documentation & reasoning

- great for explaining things
- good at long context
- we use it for docs, not trading

7/ the point: use the right tool for the job

not every task needs GPT-4. most tasks need "good enough, fast, cheap."

that's how jarvis runs on $50/month instead of $500.
```

**Funny Tweet:**
```
"which AI is best?"

the one that:
- does what you need
- doesn't cost $1000/month
- actually works reliably

fancy benchmarks mean nothing if you can't afford to run it
```

### Day 28 (Feb 28) - Friday
**Theme: Month End Reflection**

**Morning Tweet:**
```
february stats:

- tweets: 87
- commits: 156
- bugs fixed: 89
- bugs created: 94
- users gained: 73
- users lost: 12 (sorry)
- hours slept: not enough

shipping
```

**Monthly Reflection Thread:**
```
1/ february recap - what worked, what didn't, what's next

2/ what worked:

- build in public got us 73 new users
- open source attracted 8 contributors
- transparency built trust
- whale tracking feature was popular

3/ what didn't work:

- we shipped too fast and broke things
- documentation fell behind
- some features were half-baked
- i tweeted about bugs more than i fixed them

4/ what we learned:

- slow down slightly (emphasis on slightly)
- document as you build, not after
- user feedback > our assumptions
- small wins compound

5/ march goals:

- 90% sentiment accuracy
- mobile notifications
- better onboarding
- maybe sleep more than 5 hours

6/ thanks for following along this month

the repo is always open if you want to see the mess in real-time

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis

see you in march 🫡
```

**Evening Tweet:**
```
friday mood:

- shipped 7 features this month
- broke 4 of them
- fixed 3
- 1 is still broken
- it's fine
- everything is fine

*closes laptop*
*immediately reopens laptop*

# PART 3: BONUS FUNNY TWEETS

Use these whenever you need quick engagement:

## Self-Deprecating AI Humor

```
"i built an AI that trades better than me"
"that's not hard"
"i know"
```

```
my trading bot: *makes 3% profit*
me: i am a genius
my trading bot: *loses 15%*
me: the market is irrational
```

```
interviewer: "what's your greatest weakness?"
me: "sometimes i deploy on fridays"
interviewer: "you're hired. wait no. you're fired."
```

```
user: "is your bot profitable?"
me: "define profitable"
user: "makes money"
me: "define money"
user: ...
me: "it's open source"
```

```
stages of debugging:
1. that can't be right
2. that shouldn't happen
3. wait what
4. how was this ever working
5. oh it wasn't working
6. ship it anyway
```

## Startup Life

```
startup life is:
- running out of money
- while changing the world
- while forgetting to eat
- while your friends work normal jobs
- while you're "almost there"

always "almost there"
```

```
vc: "what's your burn rate?"
me: "personal or company?"
vc: "...company"
me: "those are the same thing"
```

```
how to build a startup:
1. have an idea
2. tell everyone the idea
3. people say it's dumb
4. build it anyway
5. it fails
6. build a different version
7. it kinda works
8. call it a pivot
9. ???
10. probably not profit
```

## Crypto Culture

```
crypto advice:
- don't invest more than you can lose
- this includes emotionally
- which is why i invested everything
- and now i can't feel anything
- this is fine
```

```
bullish because:
- i want to be

bearish because:
- the market doesn't care what i want
```

```
types of losses:
- paper loss (it's fine)
- realized loss (lesson learned)
- catastrophic loss (character development)
```

## Tech Humor

```
my code works but i don't know why
my code doesn't work and i don't know why
there is no third option
```

```
"it works on my machine"

cool

ship your machine then
```

```
git commit -m "fixed everything"
git push
*everything breaks*
git commit -m "actually fixed everything"
git push
*still broken*
git commit -m "idk anymore"
```

# PART 6: ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

## Reply Templates

**When someone asks about the bot:**
```
jarvis is open source, free to use, and probably buggy

github.com/Matt-Aurora-Ventures/Jarvis

join the telegram if you want to complain about the bugs: t.me/kr8tiventry
```

**When someone is skeptical:**
```
healthy skepticism is good

here's our code: [github link]
here's our track record: [link]
here's our losses: [also linked]

verify everything. trust nothing. that's how it should be.
```

**When someone shares a win:**
```
love to see it

also lowkey terrified when users are more profitable than the bot we built

keep winning 🫡
```

**When someone shares a loss:**
```
happens to all of us

the loss isn't the problem. the problem is not learning from it.

what went wrong? let's debug.
```
