# Jarvis LifeOS Documentation

**A Persistent, Personal Context Engine**

Welcome to the complete documentation for Jarvis LifeOS - the AI system that starts with crypto trading and expands into a universal personal operating system.

> **Canonical docs:** The root [`README.md`](../../README.md) is the authoritative source
> for product narrative, system overview, and deployment guidance. Legacy README variants
> are archived under [`docs/history`](../history).

## What is Jarvis?

Jarvis is not just an app, a bot, or a trading system.

**Jarvis is a persistent, personal context engine** - a mesh of intelligent layers working together to quietly run, optimize, and upgrade your life in the background.

### The Vision

Inspired by Iron Man's Jarvis, this system:
- Knows you across all devices
- Understands your preferences, habits, and goals
- Adapts to you instead of requiring you to adapt to it
- Operates autonomously, improving itself continuously
- Makes advanced AI accessible to everyone

### Current State (v4.6.5)

**Production-Ready System:**
- **27,000+ lines** of Python code
- **1200+ passing tests**
- **81+ trading strategies** with sophisticated risk management
- **Live on Solana mainnet** via Jupiter DEX
- **6 major bot components** running autonomously
- **18 MCP integrations** for cross-session learning
- **100+ semantic memory learnings** with BGE embeddings

## Why Crypto First?

Jarvis started in crypto **intentionally** - not as its identity, but as its **training ground**.

Crypto provides:
- Real-time markets with immediate feedback
- On-chain execution and transparent outcomes
- Autonomous capital movement
- Programmable incentives
- Global, permissionless access

If a system can survive markets, it can survive anything.

Once proven in trading, Jarvis expands into:
- Productivity and communication
- Smart devices and homes
- Health and wellness
- Vehicles and robotics
