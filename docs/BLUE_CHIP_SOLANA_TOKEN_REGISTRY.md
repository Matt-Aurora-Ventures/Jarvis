## Volatility & Correlation Analysis

### Typical Volatility Ranges (Based on 2025 and Early 2026 Data)

| Category | Token Examples | Daily Range | Weekly Range | Monthly Range | Annual Max Drawdown |
|----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Layer 1** | SOL | 3-8% | 10-20% | 20-40% | 55-70% from peaks |
| **DeFi Blue Chip** | JUP, RAY, JTO | 5-10% | 15-25% | 25-50% | 70-96% from peaks |
| **Infrastructure** | PYTH, RENDER, HNT | 4-8% | 15-25% | 25-50% | 75-96% from peaks |
| **Established Meme** | BONK, WIF | 5-15% | 20-50% | 30-70% | 78-95% from peaks |
| **Mid-Cap Meme** | POPCAT | 8-20% | 25-60% | 40-80% | 83-97% from peaks |

### SOL-BTC Correlation

The SOL-BTC correlation has been exceptionally high:
- **0.97-0.99** throughout late 2025 and into 2026 (per DeFiLlama)
- SOL acts as a **high-beta BTC proxy** -- amplifying BTC moves in both directions
- When BTC dropped from $90K to $66K, SOL fell from $294 to $81 (a much larger percentage decline)

### Solana Ecosystem Token Correlations with SOL

| Token | SOL Correlation | Beta to SOL | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| JUP | Very High (~0.90+) | ~1.2-1.5x | Moves with SOL, slightly amplified |
| RAY | Very High (~0.85+) | ~1.3-1.5x | Primary AMM -- correlated to Solana DeFi activity |
| ORCA | High (~0.80+) | ~1.2-1.4x | AMM -- similar to RAY |
| PYTH | High (~0.80+) | ~1.2-1.5x | Infrastructure, but trades as altcoin |
| JTO | High (~0.85+) | ~1.3-1.5x | Staking derivative, tightly coupled to SOL |
| RENDER | Moderate (~0.72) | ~1.0-1.3x | AI narrative provides some decorrelation |
| HNT | Moderate (~0.65-0.75) | ~1.0-1.3x | DePIN narrative + real-world usage provides some decorrelation |
| BONK | High (~0.80+) | ~1.5-2.5x | Amplified SOL moves, sentiment-driven spikes |
| WIF | High (~0.75+) | ~1.5-3.0x | Extreme beta during hype cycles |
| POPCAT | Moderate-High (~0.70+) | ~2.0-3.0x | Highest beta of established memes |
| MNDE | High (~0.80+) | ~1.2-1.5x | Tied to SOL staking |
| DRIFT | High (~0.80+) | ~1.5-2.0x | Perps volume correlated to SOL activity |

### Key Insight: Decorrelation Opportunities

Tokens with the MOST independence from pure SOL/BTC movement:
1. **RENDER** -- AI/GPU narrative can diverge from pure crypto sentiment
2. **HNT** -- Real-world telco partnerships (AT&T, Telefonica) provide fundamental floor
3. **PYTH** -- Oracle infrastructure used across 100+ chains, not just Solana

Tokens with the LEAST independence (pure beta plays):
1. **JTO** -- Directly tied to SOL staking
2. **RAY/ORCA** -- DEX activity correlated to SOL volume
3. **BONK/WIF** -- Memecoin sentiment amplifies SOL moves

## Risk-Adjusted Return Analysis

### Historical Performance Tiers (2024-2026)

**Best risk-adjusted returns (considering drawdown vs. upside):**

| Rank | Token | Peak-to-Trough DD | Recovery Potential | Risk/Reward Assessment |
|------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **SOL** | -71% from ATH | Institutional backing (ETFs), L1 fundamentals | BEST risk-adjusted. Spot ETFs provide floor. |
| 2 | **JUP** | -90% from ATH | Dominant DEX aggregator, $700M+ daily routing | Strong fundamentals, but token unlock pressure |
| 3 | **RAY** | -96% from ATH | Primary AMM, fee buyback mechanism | Deflationary mechanics help, deep drawdown |
| 4 | **RENDER** | -90% from ATH | AI narrative + real GPU demand | Sector tailwinds (AI boom), but tokenomics weak |
| 5 | **JTO** | -95% from ATH | $1.9B staked, critical infrastructure | Deep DD but protocol is thriving |
| 6 | **BONK** | -89% from ATH | Solana's flagship meme, deep ecosystem integration | Best memecoin risk/reward on Solana |
| 7 | **PYTH** | -96% from ATH | 100+ chain oracle, essential infrastructure | Near ATL -- high risk but asymmetric upside |
| 8 | **HNT** | -93% from ATH | Real-world revenue (telco partnerships) | Unique fundamental thesis |
| 9 | **WIF** | -95% from ATH | Cultural icon but less utility than BONK | High volume suggests active interest |
| 10 | **ORCA** | -96% from ATH | Concentrated liquidity pioneer | Lower volume is a concern |
| 11 | **MNDE** | -93% from ATH | Staking governance, ETF potential | Low volume, governance-only utility |
| 12 | **DRIFT** | -97% from ATH | Growing perps platform, $350M TVL | Young token, may not have found floor |
| 13 | **POPCAT** | -97% from ATH | Pure meme, no utility | Highest risk, highest beta |

### Recommended Position Sizing by Tier

| Tier | Tokens | Max Position % | Stop Loss | Take Profit |
|------|--------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Blue Chip** | SOL | 10-20% of portfolio | 15% | 30-50% |

| **Infrastructure** | PYTH, RENDER, HNT | 2-4% each | 15-20% | 25-40% |
| **Tier 2 DeFi** | ORCA, MNDE, DRIFT | 1-3% each | 20% | 25-40% |
| **Established Meme** | BONK, WIF | 1-3% each | 20-25% | 30-50% |
| **Mid-Cap Meme** | POPCAT | 0.5-1% | 25-30% | 40-100% |
