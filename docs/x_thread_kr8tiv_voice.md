# X THREAD (KR8TIV Voice)

**1/**
not advice. not audited. use at your own risk.

but if you're building AI agents in 2026… here's the stack we're running (and watching)

**2/**
agents aren't chatbots anymore.

they're: skills + memory + tools + OAuth + actual security

basically a mess of moving parts that all have to work together

**3/**
FIRST: secure your VPS or get wrecked.

brute force attempts are already happening. @the_smart_ape knows what's up.

**4/**
SECOND: read this with a defender mindset.

vibecoding + agents + sloppy secrets = you're cooked.

@mrnacknack breaking down why this matters:

**5/**
agent amnesia is real.

enable memory flush before compaction or your agents will forget everything mid-conversation.

@AlexFinn with the fix:

**6/**
skills.sh is basically the npm for AI agent capabilities now

we're using it. so is everyone else.
https://skills.sh/

**7/**
Kimi K2.5 — open-source multimodal agentic model

people are watching this one. we're testing it.

**8/**
PromptForge = treating prompts like actual code

tests, evals, versioning. the way it should be.
https://github.com/insaaniManav/prompt-forge

**9/**
PentestAgent (authorized use only)

this is where security is heading: agent vs agent.

red team automation. wild stuff.
https://github.com/GH05TCREW/pentestagent

**10/**
voice + video + local-first is moving fast

HuggingModels, LTX-2, AgenticSeek

this is becoming product UX, not demo tricks anymore

**11/**
we're KR8TIV AI.

building Jarvis in public. debugging in real-time. shipping with receipts.

**ALTERNATIVE VERSION (More Condensed)**

**1/**
not advice. not audited. DYOR.

but here's the AI agent stack we're running in 2026:

**2/**
agents = skills + memory + tools + OAuth + security

it's not chatbots anymore. it's infrastructure.

**3/**
secure your VPS first.

brute force is real. @the_smart_ape has receipts:

vibecoding + sloppy secrets = disaster
