# PR Policy (Research Proposals)

Research can propose changes; humans approve. CI must pass and rollback is required.

## Rules
- Research outputs **must** be `PROPOSED` (never auto-merge).
- Every proposal must include citations, evaluation plan, tests, and rollback.
- PRs must reference `/docs/CHANGE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Production-impacting changes require human approval.
